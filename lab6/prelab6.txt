1.  The 12 bits of data are stored in the 16 bits of DAC0/DAC1 data SFRs
    by the following:

    In DACnCN register, there lower 3 bits control the data format for the dac.
    You can set it up so that you can pack the 12 bits with the LSB in the
    LSB location in the DACnL SFR. This makes the most significant nibble in
    the first 4 bits of DACnH.

    There are 4 other modes and they appear to be a shifting of the data in the
    DACn data SFRs.

2.  Addresses: (from page ~148)

    DAC0L   0xD2 #SFR Page 0
    DAC1L   0xD2 #SFR Page 1
    TMR2L   0xCC #SFR Page 0
    RCAP2L  0xCA #SFR Page 0
    DAC0H   0xD3 #SFR Page 0
    DAC1H   0xD3 #SFR Page 1
    TMR2H   0xCD #SFR Page 0
    RCAP2H  0xCB #SFR Page 0

3a. Perhaps to adjust the volume we can just multiply the sound data by a
    scalar in order to increase the amplitude. To adjust the balance we can
    just multiply one channel and leave the other channel alone or attenuate
    it by multiplying by a value less than 1.

3b. To adjust the volume via the DAC, we just multiply by shifting. However
    this can be done by changing the DAC settings in DACnCN.

    ie: initially set DACnCN to 0bXXXXX010
        to turn up the volume: decrement DACnCN
        to turn down the volume: increment DACnCN


    A similar thing can be done for the balance, where we would decrement 1 channel or the other. Where channel is either DAC0CN or DAC1CN.
    Note that we should never increment DACnCN past 0bXXXXX111 or decrement DACnCN to 0bXXXXX000, otherwise we would be interfering with bits other than the DACnDF bits (DACnCN[3:0]).

4.  void dacout(void) interrupt n:

    if(!dactive){
        if bytesleft == 0 then
            write to DAC0: 80H
            write to DAC1: 80H
            return;
        else
            if(isStereo) then
                write to DAC0: data at buffptr
                write to DAC1: data at buffptr + 1
            else
                write to both DACs: data at buffptr
            decrement bytesleft by number of bytes sent
            if(bytesleft == 0)
                clear dacactive
            return;
    }
